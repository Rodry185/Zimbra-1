<h1>Attachment file types supported</h1>
<p>You can open any attachment in your email directly from the @ClientNameLong@, 
 provided that your workstation has the right application and the extension 
 is not blocked by your system administrator. &#160;For example, to open 
 a document created using Microsoft Word, you need to be able to run Microsoft 
 Word on your computer.</p>
<p>On most computers, the file type is indicated by the extension, which 
 is usually a period followed by a three-letter code. Examples could include 
 files such as <span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>expenses.xls</b></span> 
 or <span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>New-Items.doc</b></span>. 
 If the file type is one that is supported by the installed software on 
 your computer, you can typically double-click the file and your computer 
 will automatically launch the right application for reading that file.</p>
<p>Many types of files can be opened directly from your browser using various 
 plug-ins. Usually, if you click a file link on a page, your browser automatically 
 detects whether or not you have the right plug-in, and prompts you to 
 download it. Note that your system administration policies may not permit 
 end users to download and install any sort of software.</p>
<p class="note" style="font-weight: bold;">Notes: <span style="font-weight: normal;"><br />
On Windows computers, the computer assumes that the file type in the filename 
 matches the actual format. Even if the file is correctly formatted internally, 
 if it does not have the right file type extension in the filename, your 
 computer may not be able to recognize it and open the right application 
 for you.<br />
<br />
An increasing number of computer viruses have been designed to spread via 
 file attachments. Therefore, in some environments, system administrators 
 have opted to block incoming mail containing certain types of attachments, 
 most notably files with the extension .EXE or .ZIP as part of their filename. If you send an email 
 message to someone whose email system has been configured to block certain 
 types of attachments, you may or may not receive any notification that 
 it was blocked.</span></p>
<h2>For your reference, here are some widely used file extensions</h2>
<ul type="disc">
