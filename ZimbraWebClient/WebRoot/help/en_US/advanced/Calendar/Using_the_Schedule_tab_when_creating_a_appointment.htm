<h1>Using the scheduling tool to view attendee and location availability</h1>
<p>The Calendar scheduling tool can assist you with&#160;finding the next-available 
 free times and meeting locations across your organization. You can set 
 up preferences for preferred meeting times, buildings, location and room 
 size. </p>
<p>As you enter attendee names, the scheduling tool begins to suggest times 
 and locations in the Overview pane. You also have the option to look for 
 a location for your meeting before adding attendees. If you set up your 
 location preferences, only these locations are displayed.</p>
<h2>Setting your scheduling preferences</h2>
<p>The scheduling tool is enabled by default to automatically display attendee 
 and location availability as soon as you enter the first attendee name 
 in the Attendee field. In the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Suggestion 
 Preferences</b></span> dialog, you can change the default to manual and configure 
 other scheduling preferences to manage what is displayed.</p>
<p>When working in Calendar, click the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Suggested 
 Times</b></span> heading in the Calendar Overview pane to open the Suggestion 
 Preferences dialog. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="../cas_suggestedtimes_options.png" alt="cas_suggestedtimes_options.png" style="border: none;" width="110" height="132" border="0" /></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">Configure the following options:</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Suggestions</b></span>. The options 
	 are <span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Automatic</b></span> (default)&#160;or 
	 <span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Manual</b></span>. </p></li>
	<ul type="circle">
		<li><p>When <span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Automatic</b></span> is 
		 selected, as you start to enter text in the Attendees field, the 
		 Calendar Overview pane displays suggest times and locations in 
		 30 minute intervals.</p></li>
		<li><p>To display the attendee time and locations manually, select 
		 <span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Manual</b></span>. When you want 
		 to see&#160;the attendee/location information, click <span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Show 
		 Suggestions for (date)</b></span> in the Suggested Times area. </p></li>
	</ul>
	<li><p style="font-weight: bold;">Location Preferences<span style="font-weight: normal;">. 
	 &#160;In this section, you can define what type of locations you want 
	 included in your search. &#160;Leave this section blank if you have 
	 no location preferences. </span></p></li>
	<ul type="circle">
		<li><p style="font-weight: normal;">In the name field you can enter 
		 a partial location name and &#160;locations with that string in 
		 the name are included in the search. &#160;For example, Rooms 
		 in building 3 include &#160;&quot;Bldg3&quot; in their location 
		 name. &#160;If you add &quot;Bldg3&quot; in the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Name</b></span> 
		 field, only locations that have &quot;Bldg3&quot; in the name 
		 will be suggested. </p></li>
		<li><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">If 
		 you do not want locations to be suggested with attendee availability, 
		 uncheck </span>Suggest available rooms<span style="font-weight: normal;">. 
		 &#160;</span></p></li>
	</ul>
	<li><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Time Preferences</b></span>. You 
	 specify which hours should be included in the search for attendees 
	 availability. </p></li>
	<ul type="circle">
		<li><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>My Working Hours Only</b></span>. 
		 Searches only for times that meet your configured working hours. 
		 This is the work week and hours you set in your Calendar preferences.</p></li>
		<li><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>All Attendee Working Hours.</b></span> 
		 When searching for a location it takes into consideration everyone's 
		 working hours. <span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Note</b></span>:&#160;If 
		 you include attendees from different time zones, especially those 
		 that are many time zones away, you will never be able to find 
		 a location to accommodate all attendees. &#160;In this case, the 
		 suggestion panel does not show any location resources.</p></li>
		<li><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Non-Working Hours</b></span>. 
		 This search schedules for hours that are not marked as working, 
		 such as evenings and weekends.</p></li>
		<li><p>If you want to see only times and locations when all attendees 
		 are available , you can check the &#160;box <span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Show 
		 only the times when all attendees are available</b></span>.</p></li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h2>How the scheduling tool works</h2>
<p>When you schedule meetings, you can check to see when attendees are 
 busy or free so you can find a good time for all attendees to meet. As 
 you add attendees to the Attendees field, a suggestion panel in the Overview 
 pane shows availability in 30 minute time slots for the attendees and 
 for at least one room (location). The number on the right of the time 
 is the number of locations that are available for this time. You can click 
 this number to see a list of suggested locations and to select a location. 
 The selected location is added to the Location field on the appointment 
 page.</p>
<p class="note"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Note</b></span>: Room locations 
 are displayed if they have been configured in the company directory.</p>
<p>The mini-calendar suggests attendee availability by color code.</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li><p>Green means that all attendees and at least one location is 
	 available for those days. </p></li>
	<li><p>Orange means that not everyone can attend but more than half 
	 can and at least one location is available. You can hover the cursor 
	 over the date to see the names of up to 10 people who are not available.</p></li>
	<li><p>Red means that more than half of the attendees cannot attend 
	 the meeting on those days. </p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the example below, all attendees are available all month except for 
 January 18. Less than half are available on that date.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>To select a suggested time, click on the row. The Start and End time 
 fields on the appointment page are updated.</p>
<p>To select a location, click on the number in the row with the suggested 
 time. Select a location from the list that is displayed. The location 
 is added to the Location field. </p>
