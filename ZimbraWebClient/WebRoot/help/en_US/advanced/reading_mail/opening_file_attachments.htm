<h1>Opening file attachments</h1>
<p>Email messages can include attached files such as word processing documents, 
 spreadsheets, text files, ZIP files, images, executable applications, 
 or any other type of computer file that resides on the sender's computer 
 network. Messages that contain attachments display a paper clip next to 
 the subject.</p>
<p>Some types of files, such as JPEG images 
 or text files, can be opened on almost any computer system. Others, such 
 as Microsoft Word documents, must be opened 
 using the same application that created them.</p>

<p>When you receive a message 
 containing file attachments, you can double-click on the item in the attachments 
 section of the message header. A dialog appears asking whether you want 
 to open or save the file first.</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="p"><p>If you choose to view the attachment, you must have 
	 an application on your workstation that can read that type of file.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>If you choose to download the attachment, a browse 
	 dialog appears showing your current file system. Choose an appropriate 
	 location and save the file. You can open the file at a later point 
	 outside of your email client.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="note" style="margin-left: 36px;"><span 
	 style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Note</b></span>: Attachments can be deleted 
 from your email message. Clicking &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Remove 
 all attachments</b></span> deletes the files from your mailbox. When you remove 
 an attachment, it is immediately deleted from your mailbox. &#160;</p>
<h2>View Attachments as HTML</h2>
<p>You may have the feature to view attachments as HTML. This allows you 
 to open an attachment even if the corresponding application is not installed. 
 &#160;Click <span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>view as html</b></span> 
 to view the content of the file. This feature is set by your system administrator.</p>
<h3>Virus Safety</h3>
<p>Computer viruses can spread through email attachments. It is considered 
 standard practice for mail administrators to implement virus filtering 
 for incoming mail as well as virus scanning for personal computers. However, 
 there is always a chance that something could get through.</p>
<p>In the case of email viruses, the majority of them are activated when 
 a file attachment containing the virus is opened or viewed. Many of these 
 viruses have been known to spread themselves using entries in users' address 
 books. Therefore, we recommend that you use care when opening file attachments, 
 even from senders who appear to be known to you.</p>
