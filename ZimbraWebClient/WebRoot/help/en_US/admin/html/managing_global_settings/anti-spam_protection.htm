<h1>Anti-Spam Protection</h1>
<p>Mass unsolicited emails are referred to 
 as spam or junk email. The Zimbra Collaboration Server 
 installs the SpamAssassin anti-spam 
 software as the mail filter to identify spam 
 mail. When you installed the Zimbra Collaboration Server, 
 the anti-spam software is automatically enabled.</p>
<p>You can set rules for handling spam from 
 the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Global Settings&gt;Anti-Spam</b></span> 
 tab. How these rules are configured determine how aggressively spam is filtered. The following options can be changed:</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="p"><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Kill percent</b></span> 
	 at 75%. Mail that is scored at 75% is considered spam and is not delivered.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Tag percent</b></span> 
	 at 33%. Mail that is scored at 33% is considered spam and is delivered 
	 to the Junk folder.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Subject prefix</b></span> 
	 field is blank. The prefix entered in this field is added to the subject 
	 line for messages tagged as spam.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When ZCS was 
 installed, an automated spam training filter was enabled.</p>
<p>Two mail accounts were created.</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="p"><p>The Spam Training User address receives mail notification 
	 about mail that was not marked as spam, but should have been.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>The Non-Spam (HAM) 
	 Training User address receives mail notification about mail that was 
	 marked as spam but should not have been.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For these training accounts, the mailbox quota is disabled (i.e. set 
 to 0). Disabling quotas prevents bouncing messages when the mailbox is 
 full. Attachment indexing is also disabled.</p>
<p>Spam email messages are indexed, but you can disable indexing of spam 
 email messages from the COS Preferences tab.</p>
<p>When a message is tagged as spam, the message is delivered to the recipient’s 
 Spam folder. Users can view the number of unread messages and can open 
 the Spam folder to review the messages marked as spam.</p>
<ul>
	<li class="p-note"><p class="note" 
		 style="margin-left: 0px;">To turn RBL's 
	 on or off refer to the Administrator Guide, Managing the Zimbra Collaboration Serverchapter.</p></li>
</ul>
